# 2048 Game

## Description
This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game. The objective is to combine tiles with the same value by moving them in four possible directions (up, down, left, right) until you reach the 2048 tile. With every move, a new tile is generated, adding complexity to the game.

## Features
- Intuitive graphical interface (or console-based, depending on your implementation).
- Smooth tile movement and merging mechanics.
- Real-time score tracking.
- Random tile generation at each move.
- Win by reaching the 2048 tile or challenge yourself to go even further!

## Technologies Used
- [Insert programming language used, e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.]
- [Any libraries or frameworks, e.g., Pygame, Tkinter, etc.]

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys (or your input method) to move the tiles.
2. Combine tiles of the same value to increase their total.
3. Reach the 2048 tile to win, but you can keep playing to achieve higher scores!
